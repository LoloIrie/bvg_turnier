Tool to embed a tournament on your page with administration features



== Description ==

I need a tool to manage an internal tournament for our badminton club (BVG Goldbach/Laufach) and didn't find anything to fill exactly my need...

This tool allows administrators to create and manage different tournaments like:
- League
- Grinding tournament
- Swiss System
- KO System

Simple, double or mixed are allowed.

With few shortcodes, it's really easy to display infos ( table, matches...) on the frontend website.



== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/bvg_turnier` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the 'Bad Tournament' Link to manage your tournaments
